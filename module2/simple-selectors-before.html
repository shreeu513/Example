	<h1>Simple Selectors (h1)</h1>
	<h2>Subheading 1 (h2)</h2>
	<p class="highlight">In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character. The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them individually, or only select the element when all of the classes in the selector are present. This can be helpful when building up components that can be combined in different ways on your site.
