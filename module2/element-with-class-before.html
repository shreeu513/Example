	<h1 class="highlight">Element with Class Selector</h1>
	<p>In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character. The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">This is P with class highlight.
	</p>

	<div class="mainPoint highlight"> This is the main point of the entire article.
